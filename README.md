- 👋 Hi, I’m @t3chpirat3
- 👀 I’m interested in iOS bug hunting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Ruby and Swift. Python and Ruby because im training to be a data scientist. Swift is just a hobby. Im also a certified Java programmer and Economist by profession. Very confusing, I know. C'est la vie.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, really. I don't mind to dabble in this or that. We learn something new every day.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, right here of course!
